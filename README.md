# web_fcker_DOS_attacker
I watched a lot of hacking movies and then developed that hack-tool. Its a nice damn DoS attack tool like XerXes. You are responsible for everything you do with it. I just uploaded it for educational purposes. I want to make it clear that I am not responsible for any attacks you may do. Please use it to learn for good.
